# u-blox7 USB GPS
This is a piece of programming, primarily written to learn Python.

It has the side effect of testing a u-blox7 USB GPS device, ultimately perhaps pretending to be like gpsmon, although of course, far less proficient.

Still, I'm having fun learning about Python, GPS messages and some arcane things about GPS like "hard wired leap seconds".
